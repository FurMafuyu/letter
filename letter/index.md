-- Miausrick... I received a letter about the death of my son. I tried everything I could trying to have information about who wrote it... But it's very strange, it was not even something I've ever seen.
-- Are you speaking philosophical again, Belfort? 
-- I am serious. I don't even have a son? 
-- It's probably just some peasant that is after you. You can probably just not care, no one can get to you anyway.
-- I have never seen something like that Miausrick. It was just a little.. stone.. and when I touched it, it speaked into my head and disappeared. I am not making fun of you!
-- I can't tell you anything. I don't know piece of what you're talking about. 
-- They said they met me once thirty years ago.
-- You are not even thirty yet, Belfort, it's nonsense. And if you don't know what it is, it's probably just a thing from some academician.
-- A little joke they would've played on me? Can't see why... I will probably ask them about.
-- Sure not, they'll know it succeeded if you talk about it. Just ignore it, or maybe try to recreate the speaking thing? You're way more powerful than any of them, nothing you can do.
-- You're right
